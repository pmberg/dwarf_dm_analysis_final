# dwarf_dm_analysis_final

## By Peter Berggren

This repository is intended to store the programs used to generate figures in my 2022 report, "Characteristics of Dwarf Galaxies Simulated
Under Cold Dark Matter Models." Figures 1 through 5 can be generated by code in their respective programs. The read_text programs are intended to generate Figures 3 and 5, given data in plaintext files, as the data take so long to generate. jeans_preprocessing.py is code used to generate the sampled stars used to generate Jeans analyses with Tri Nguyen's library (discussed in the report), while morphokinematicsdiagnostics.py is a slight modification of Adrien Thob's library, as used in fig_3_generator.py.
